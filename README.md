# jetmidi
Play midi over the internet, with websockets

You can see status of the pipes, [here](http://jetmidi.herokuapp.com/).

Please be nice and don't crash other people's pipes (until I get some auth in there.)

# cli

After installing with `npm install -g jetmidi`, you can run `jetmidi` to get some help.

# gui

You can get a working GUI version from [releases](https://github.com/konsumer/jetmidi/releases). This just uses nodewebkit and listens for MIDI.
