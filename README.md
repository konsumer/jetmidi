# jetmidi
Play midi over the internet, with websockets

You can see status of the pipes, [here](https://jetmidi.herokuapp.com/).

Please be nice and don't crash other people's pipes (until I get some auth in there.)

# cli

I have only completed the CLI version, but this should get you started. I have a GUI planned.  After installing with `npm install -g jetmidi`, you can run `jetmidi` to get some help.
